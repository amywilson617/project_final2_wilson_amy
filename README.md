# Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
* This project got me back into the swing of things as far and building a website from the ground up. I greatly prefer this to jumping in to someone else's existing code.
* I have untitled sections in my HTML5 outliner because this is not a functioning web page with traditional HTML5 formatting, as it is being used as a style prototype.
* Same goes for my sections lacking headings warning in the validator, there are not headings since this is a prototype and did not work in the design.
